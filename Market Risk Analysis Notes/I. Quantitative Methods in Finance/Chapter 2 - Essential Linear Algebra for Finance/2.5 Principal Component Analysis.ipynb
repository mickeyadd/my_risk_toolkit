    "Principal Component Analysis or PCA has a wide range of benefits and uses. It was often used as a tool to reduce training times, memory requirements, and overfitting in machine learning models while I was studying for my degree. Essentially it is a technique that can be used to reduce dimensionality and remove multicollinearity. "
