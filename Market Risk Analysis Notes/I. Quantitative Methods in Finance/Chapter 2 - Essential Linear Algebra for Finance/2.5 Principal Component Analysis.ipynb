    "Principal Component Analysis or PCA has a wide range of benefits and uses. It was often used as a tool to reduce training times, memory requirements, and overfitting in machine learning models while I was studying for my degree. Essentially it is a technique that can be used to reduce dimensionality and remove multicollinearity among features and is one of the most popular techniques used in financial risk management.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of PCA in financial risk management include:  \n",
    "- Multi-factor option pricing models\n",
    "- Predicting movements in implied volatility surfaces\n",
    "- Compute large-dimensional covariance matrices\n",
    "- Reduce dimensionality for stress testing and scenario analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be applied to any stationary time series but it works best for highly correlated systems such as zero coupons and commodity futures with different maturities as well as implied volatility surfaces."
